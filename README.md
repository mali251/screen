# Solo Screen

Screen is a terminal emulator written in pure PHP. It powers [Solo for Laravel](https://github.com/soloterm/solo) and
can be used to build rich text-based user interfaces in any PHP application.

> [!NOTE]
> Screen is a library intended to be integrated into PHP applications. It is not a standalone terminal application.

## About terminal emulators

A terminal emulator is software that replicates the functionality of a classic hardware computer terminal. It processes
text input and output along with special control sequences (ANSI escape codes) that control formatting, cursor movement,
and other terminal features.

Terminal emulators interpret these escape sequences to:

- Position the cursor
- Set text colors and styles (bold, underline, etc.)
- Clear parts of the screen
- Handle special character sets
- And much more

Screen implements this functionality in pure PHP, allowing developers to build terminal user interfaces without relying
on external dependencies or native code.

## Why this exists

Screen was originally created to solve a specific problem in [Solo for Laravel](https://github.com/soloterm/solo).

Solo provides a TUI (Text User Interface) that runs multiple processes simultaneously in separate panels, similar to
tmux. However, when these processes output ANSI escape codes for cursor movement and screen manipulation, they could
potentially "break out" of their visual containers and interfere with other parts of the interface.

To solve this problem, Screen creates a virtual terminal buffer where:

1. All ANSI operations (cursor movements, color changes, screen clears) happen safely within an isolated environment
2. The final rendered state is captured after all operations are processed
3. Only the final visual output is displayed to the user's terminal

This approach provides complete control over how terminal output is rendered, ensuring that complex ANSI operations stay
contained within their designated areas. While initially built for Solo, Screen has evolved into a standalone library
that can be used in any PHP application requiring terminal emulation.

## Features

- **Pure PHP Implementation**: Only one dependency ([Grapheme](https://github.com/soloterm/grapheme), another Solo
  library)
- **Comprehensive ANSI Support**: Handles cursor positioning, text styling, and screen manipulation
- **Unicode/Multibyte Support**: Properly handles UTF-8 characters including emojis and wide characters
- **Buffer Management**: Maintains separate buffers for text content and styling
- **Character Width Handling**: Correctly calculates display width for CJK and other double-width characters
- **Scrolling**: Support for vertical scrolling with proper content management

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```shell
composer require soloterm/screen
```

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- mbstring extension

## Basic usage

Here's a simple example of using Screen:

```php
use SoloTerm\Screen\Screen;

// Create a screen with dimensions (columns, rows)
$screen = new Screen(80, 24);

// Write text and ANSI escape sequences
$screen->write("Hello, \e[1;32mWorld!\e[0m");

// Move cursor and add more text
$screen->write("\e[5;10HPositioned text");

// Get the rendered content
echo $screen->output();
```

## Core concepts

Screen operates with several key components:

### Screen

The main class that coordinates all functionality. It takes care of cursor positioning, content writing, and rendering
the final output.

```php
$screen = new Screen(80, 24); // width, height
$screen->write("Text and ANSI codes");
```

### Buffers

Screen uses multiple buffer types to track content and styling:

- **PrintableBuffer**: Stores visible characters and handles width calculations
- **AnsiBuffer**: Tracks styling information (colors, bold, underline, etc.)

### ANSI processing

Screen correctly handles ANSI escape sequences for:

- Cursor movement (up, down, left, right, absolute positioning)
- Text styling (colors, bold, italic, underline)
- Screen clearing and line manipulation
- Scrolling

## Advanced features

### Cursor positioning

```php
// Move cursor to position (row 5, column 10)
$screen->write("\e[5;10H");

// Move cursor up 3 lines
$screen->write("\e[3A");

// Save and restore cursor position
$screen->write("\e7"); // Save
$screen->write("More text");
$screen->write("\e8"); // Restore
```

### Text styling

```php
// Bold red text
$screen->write("\e[1;31mImportant message\e[0m");

// Background colors
$screen->write("\e[44mBlue background\e[0m");

// 256-color support
$screen->write("\e[38;5;208mOrange text\e[0m");

// RGB colors
$screen->write("\e[38;2;255;100;0mCustom color\e[0m");
```

### Screen manipulation

```php
// Clear screen
$screen->write("\e[2J");

// Clear from cursor to end of line
$screen->write("\e[0K");

// Insert lines
$screen->write("\e[2L");

// Scroll up
$screen->write("\e[2S");
```

## Custom integrations

You can respond to terminal queries by setting a callback:

```php
$screen->respondToQueriesVia(function($response) {
    // Process response (like cursor position)
    echo $response;
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is still a work in progress. We need some more tests / use cases here.

## Example: building a simple UI

```php
use SoloTerm\Screen\Screen;

$screen = new Screen(80, 24);

// Draw a border
$screen->write("┌" . str_repeat("─", 78) . "┐\n");
for ($i = 0; $i < 22; $i++) {
    $screen->write("│" . str_repeat(" ", 78) . "│\n");
}
$screen->write("└" . str_repeat("─", 78) . "┘");

// Add a title
$screen->write("\e[1;30H\e[1;36mMy Application\e[0m");

// Add some content
$screen->write("\e[5;5HWelcome to the application!");
$screen->write("\e[7;5HPress 'q' to quit.");

// Render
echo $screen->output();
```

## Handling unicode and wide characters

Screen properly handles Unicode characters including emoji and CJK characters that take up multiple columns:

```php
$screen->write("Regular text: Hello");
$screen->write("\nWide characters: 你好世界");
$screen->write("\nEmoji: 🚀 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 🌍");
```

## Testing

Screen includes a comprehensive testing suite that features a unique visual comparison system:

```shell
composer test
```

### Visual testing

Screen employs an innovative screenshot-based testing approach (see `ComparesVisually` trait) that validates the visual
output:

1. The test renders content in a real terminal (iTerm)
2. It captures a screenshot of the terminal output
3. It runs the same content through the Screen emulator
4. It captures a screenshot of the emulated output
5. It compares the screenshots pixel-by-pixel to ensure accuracy

This testing strategy ensures that Screen's emulation accurately matches real terminal behavior, especially for complex
scenarios involving:

- Multi-byte characters
- Complex ANSI formatting
- Cursor movements
- Scrolling behavior
- Line wrapping

For environments without screenshot capabilities, tests can fall back to fixture-based comparison, making the test suite
versatile for CI/CD pipelines.

To enable screenshots for all tests, use the following command:

```shell
ENABLE_SCREENSHOT_TESTING=1 composer test
```

To enable screenshots for only the tests that dont' already have fixtures, use the following command:

```shell
ENABLE_SCREENSHOT_TESTING=2 composer test
```
